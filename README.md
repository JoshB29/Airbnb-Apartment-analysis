# Airbnb-Apartment-analysis

##Overview

This analysis was performed for a real estate investor to see whether a 5 bedroom apartment (with an asking price of ~$4 million) could be recouped using airbnb rentals. The investor wanted to know whether, if they bought the apartment for $4 million, at what price would the apartment have to be rented out to pay for the morgage. Assuming a 10-year morgage, this corresponds to a monthly morgage of about $33,000 dollars (4,000,000/(12\*10)). This excludes, interest of course.

##Data Scources
